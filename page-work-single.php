								<h4 class="smallTitle white">The Challenge</h4>
								<p>Mad Dragon Music is a record label run by students of Drexel’s Music Industry
							 	program. They provided me with a newly designed logo and an overview of what pages they wanted 
							 	on the site. Words they were looking for in the design were “hip”, “modern”, and “minimal”.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div id="workDesc">
							<p>The beginning of the process was an ongoing discussion with the client on what they were 
							looking for. They showed me several websites they liked and we discussed what they liked about 
							them. I did research on record label websites that I liked and we looked at what elements might 
							work for the specific needs of Mad Dragon Records. </p>
							<p>While this was going on, a graphic design student developed a series of new logos for the 
							different sections of the music group. Using the main logo as a base, I developed the visual 
							design of the site to go with it. </p>
							<p>Once everything was ready I started building with WordPress on a bare-bones theme called Bones.
							 I used and customized several plugins to let the future site managers easily add music, photo 
							 albums, and featured news stories. I also added custom fields to blog posts to let them easily 
							 add social media links that integrate into the design</p>
